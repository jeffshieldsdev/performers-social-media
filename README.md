# performers-social-media
Website template for "one stop shopping" of event performers' social media accounts.

## Notes
This is my first PHP project

## Description
When a line-up is announced for a music festival there are sometimes many performers a concert goer may have not heard of before.  This project is an attempt to aggregate all the social media accounts (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, SoundCloud, etc.) for concert goers to easily check-out and connect with the performers.

## Social Networks
These are the social networks I'm anticipating:
* Bandcamp
* Beatport
* Facebook
* Instagram
* Last.fm
* Mixcloud
* Myspace
* Songkick
* SoundCloud
* Spotify
* Tumblr
* Twitter
* Vimeo
* YouTube

As well as their Website.

## Layout
The `performers-table` looks like this:
